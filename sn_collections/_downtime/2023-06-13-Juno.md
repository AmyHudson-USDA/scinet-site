text: "A planned maintenance evolution will occur on Tuesday, June 13th, 2023, between 6am and 5pm ET at the National Agricultural Library (NAL).
This maintenance is necessary to transfer core network equipment at NAL onto newer and more reliable backup power which will promote future stability and reliability for services at this site.</br></br>
During this time, access to Juno storage will be disrupted. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause.  </br></br>
We will be working closely with our partners to minimize the impact of this maintenance and hope to complete the work early. We will provide updates on the status of the maintenance <a href='https://forum.scinet.usda.gov/t/access-to-juno-storage-disrupted-on-june-13-2023'>on the SCINet Forum</a>."
