Ceres cluster maintenance is scheduled for October 9-10, 2023 (Indigenous Peoples Day, and the following day), to update system software.

During the maintenance we will also upgrade Open OnDemand to version 3 and BeeGFS file system to version 7.4.

Queued jobs will not start if they cannot complete by 6AM October 9. In the output of the squeue command the reason for those jobs will state (ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance) . The jobs will start after the scheduled outage completes.

Atlas cluster will be available during the Ceres maintenance. Make sure to copy data from Ceres to Atlas prior to the maintenance if needed.
