title: Reminder - Ceres Downtime February 17
excerpt: Ceres downtime is scheduled for Presidents' day, Monday, February 17th

We have a maintenance interval scheduled over Presidents' Day (Feb 17th.)
 All nodes will be down over that time and any job that would run into
 that time will not start until after the maintenance window.  The 2 week
 (and longer) queues are now running into that window. Setting a job time
 limit (`-t flag`) that completes before 2/17/2020 will solve this.
