At 6:00 PM Eastern on May 10th, the Juno long term storage system at Beltsville will be unmounted from SCINet DTNs and become inaccessible.

This is being done in preparation for network maintenance to be performed after hours.


The storage will be remounted, and access restored, the following morning.
