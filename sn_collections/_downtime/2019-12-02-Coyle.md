Ceres downtime is scheduled for  Monday, December 2 – Friday, December 6. 
    
This downtime is to rewire both power and networking on Ceres for the addition of additional compute nodes and to ready it for storage expansion.  
 
We do not anticipate any further extended downtimes for rewiring, as this should allow us to maximize the size of Ceres simply by adding additional compute nodes.

Since this affects the Authentication for SCINet, this will also affect logins to Data Transfer nodes at Ames, StoneVille, Fort Collins, Clay Center, Albany CA, and Beltsville.
 
GlobalNoc will also be upgrading software on the SCINet network infrastructure during this time.
