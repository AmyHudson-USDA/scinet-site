text: "<p>The data center that hosts Ceres cluster will have reduced cooling capacity starting the morning of April 12 and lasting through the end of the week. </p><p>
To lessen heat production generated by Ceres compute nodes during this maintenance a reservation has been created. New jobs will not start if they cannot complete by 6:00AM on April 12, 2023.</p><p></p><p>
In the output of the squeue command, the reason for those jobs will state <i>(ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance)</i>.</br>
The jobs will start after the scheduled outage completes.</p><p></p><p>
Idle nodes will be turned off. Running jobs that had started prior to reservation will be allowed to continue running as long as the temperature in the data center does not exceed the set threshold.  </p><p></p><p>
The login and DTN nodes, as well as storage are scheduled to stay up.</p><p></p><p>
More nodes may be turned back on and be available for jobs on Thursday and Friday.</br>
The Ceres cluster is expected to run at full capacity starting Monday, April 18.</p>"
