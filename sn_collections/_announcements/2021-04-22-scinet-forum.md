SCINet has launched a new discussion forum that replaces Basecamp:

[SCINet Forum](https://forum.scinet.usda.gov)

SCINet projects on Basecamp will no longer be available after April 30, 2021.

From now on all announcements will be posted on the new SCINet Forum and published in this section of the SCINet website .

SCINet users will NOT receive email notifications from SCINet Forum UNTIL they login to the Forum for the first time. To login to SCINet Forum, click [here](https://forum.scinet.usda.gov).  Then select "Log In" and use your SCINet credentials (what you use to log in to Ceres or Atlas). Make sure to append the GA 6-digit code at the end of the SCINet password.

If you wish to save any data from Basecamp to your computer, please do it before April 30, 2021.
