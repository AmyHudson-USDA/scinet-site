## No SCINet priority node purchases this year  
  
We will not be making priority node purchases through the SCINet Program this year. We added a large number of nodes to Ceres in the past several years that either replaced older, less reliable nodes or were new nodes that increased our overall capacity. In addition, we brought the Atlas Cray computer online at Mississippi State University, and we will be adding a backup storage system at the National Ag Library in the next month.   

These actions should provide sufficient computational power and storage for scientists to conduct their high-performance computing research without a unit needing to purchase its own nodes.  

We will re-assess the situation as scientific needs continue to change.
