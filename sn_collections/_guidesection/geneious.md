Ceres has a Geneious Server setup. This server is also providing 20 floating licenses for Ceres users use.


Caveats:
* The floating license server will only work at USDA sites or via VPN due to firewall restrictions.
* Geneious and its license server should work through both the regular USDA VPN and the SCINet ocvpn vpn servers. 
* If you do encounter license server issues let us know at [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](mailto:scinet_vrsc@usda.gov)


## Install and start Geneious

First download the Geneious client from [https://www.geneious.com/download/](https://www.geneious.com/download/)

Install it as usual and start it up.

Geneious will complain about not having a license. Click "Activate a License"

After Geneious is started (see picture below):
* Click on "Geneious Server" in the list of Sources on the left
   -  If you dont see "Geneious Server" in the list of "Sources" you may need to download the "Geneious Server Plugin" from the  [Geneious Downloads Page](https://geneious.scinet.usda.gov/GeneiousServer/)
   -  Download the plugin then click on the file and it should install itself.
   -  It should also be noted that the Geneious Server plugin version must match the version of the Geneious Server itsself.  If in doubt update everything to current.
   -  Geneious will need to be restarted after installing new plugins.
* You will see a message on the right "you are not currently logged in to Geneious Server". Select the "Log in" button.
* On the "Login to Geneious Server" popup screen:
   - Enter  Host name: "geneious.scinet.usda.gov"
   - Click the "Use SSL" box.  You can leave the port empty, it should fill in 443 on its own.
   - Enter your Ceres username in the "User Name" box, usually firstname.lastname
   - Enter your Ceres password immediately followed by your Ceres GA code in the "Password" box  as an example if your password was "MyP@55w0rd" and GA app is showing "123456" you would use MyP@55w0rd123456
   - Click  "OK"
