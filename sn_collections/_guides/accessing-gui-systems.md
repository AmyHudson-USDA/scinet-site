This process will be the same for all GUI based SCINet Services. Please follow the instructions below.  If you have further questions or issues, please email [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](scinet_vrsc@usda.gov). <!--excerpt-->

## Linking Your Accounts

- Select the option to sign in with "SCINet Legacy Authentication"

- You will then enter your SCINet username and your SCINet password followed by your GA code with no spaces. See the image below for examples.

- The message will appear saying "User with email user.sample@usda.gov already exists. How do you want to continue? You will select "add to existing account"

- You will then authenticate one last time using your SCINet credentials. Select "Sign In"

Your accounts have now been linked and you will not need to repeat this step.
 
## Accessing Using LincPass

If you are a LincPass holder, you will only select the option of "USDA LincPass" when logging into GUI services such as Open OnDemand, Galaxy, and the SCINet Forum. 

After selcting this, you will be automatically directed to login using your usual eAuth based login.
