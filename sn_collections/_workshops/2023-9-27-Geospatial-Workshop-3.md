This session will introduce how to use the [Raster Vision](https://rastervision.io/) framework for deep learning computer vision tasks with geospatial data. Attendees will participate in hands-on tutorials to train semantic segmentation and object detection models on satellite or other aerial imagery and explore how to modify the code for their own use cases.

## Pre-workshop suggested material
{:.border-bottom}

This tutorial will be combining raster and vector geospatial datasets. If you would like to review the basics of raster and vector data, there is a recording of last year's workshop session Fundamentals of geospatial data. The ['General geospatial data concepts', 'Vector data', and 'Raster data'](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/125dba00-b307-4675-8575-c3fe0771d914?st=130) sections of the session cover relevant concepts for this tutorial.

If you would like to have an overview of computer vision concepts covered in this tutorial, there is a recording of the introduction presentation from the SCINet AI Training Images Workshop in February 2023. The workshop was not specific to geospatial data, but the ['What is Computer Vision?' and 'What can we do with Computer Vision?'](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/1c0939d3-b90c-4ca1-a54e-025604f70366?st=175) sections of the presentation cover relevant concepts for this tutorial.

## Session objectives
{:.border-bottom}

The goals of this session are to:

* Introduce Raster Vision as a framework for implementing key computer vision tasks for satellite or aerial geospatial imagery
* Provide examples in Python on how to use Raster Vision to train a deep learning model for the following tasks for aerial images (or other geospatial raster data)
  * Semantic segmentation (pixel classification)
  * Object detection

<br>

## Agenda
{:.border-bottom}

This session will have a short presentation followed by two interactive tutorials:

* Presentation: Introduction to computer vision concepts and Raster Vision
* Python tutorials: example code for using Raster Vision for:
  * Semantic segmentation
  * Object detection
