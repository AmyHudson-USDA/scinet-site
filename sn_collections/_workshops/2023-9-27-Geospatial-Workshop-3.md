This session will introduce how to use the [Raster Vision](https://rastervision.io/) framework for deep learning computer vision tasks with geospatial data. Attendees will participate in a hands-on tutorial to train semantic segmentation and object detection models on satellite imagery and explore how to modify the code for their own use cases.

More information about the learning objectives, agenda, and tutorial instructions for this session will be added closer to the event. 

## Pre-workshop suggested material

This tutorial will be combining raster and vector geospatial datasets. If you would like to review the basics of raster and vector data, there is a recording of last year's workshop session Fundamentals of geospatial data. The ['General geospatial data concepts', 'Vector data', and 'Raster data'](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/125dba00-b307-4675-8575-c3fe0771d914?st=130) sections of the session cover relevant concepts for this tutorial.

If you would like to have an overview of computer vision concepts covered in this tutorial, there is a recording of the introduction presentation from the SCINet AI Training Images Workshop in February 2023. The workshop was not specific to geospatial data, but the ['What is Computer Vision?' and 'What can we do with Computer Vision?'](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/1c0939d3-b90c-4ca1-a54e-025604f70366?st=175) sections of the presentation cover relevant concepts for this tutorial.
