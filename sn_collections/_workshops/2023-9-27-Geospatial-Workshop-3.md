This session will introduce how to use the [Raster Vision](https://rastervision.io/) framework for deep learning computer vision tasks with geospatial data. Attendees will participate in a hands-on tutorial to train semantic segmentation and object detection models on satellite imagery and explore how to modify the code for their own use cases.

More information about the learning objectives, agenda, and tutorial instructions for this session will be added closer to the event.
