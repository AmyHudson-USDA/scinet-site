<br>

This session will introduce key concepts of GPU-based computing, including how they differ from CPUs and what kinds of computing tasks can benefit from GPUs. There will also be a hands-on tutorial showing how to use the GPUs on the Atlas cluster and how to evaluate the effect of using GPUs on your computation time. A primary goal of this session is to help participants build intuition about when GPUs might be useful in scientific computing and how to use them.
