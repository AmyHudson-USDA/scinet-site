<br>

This session will introduce key concepts of GPU-based computing, including how they differ from CPUs and what kinds of computing tasks can benefit from GPUs. There will also be a hands-on tutorial showing how to use the GPUs on the Atlas cluster and how to evaluate the effect of using GPUs on your computation time. 

More information about the learning objectives, agenda, and tutorial instructions for this session will be added closer to the event.
