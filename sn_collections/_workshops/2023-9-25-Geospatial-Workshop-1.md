## What is the SCINet Geospatial Research Working Group?
{:.border-bottom}

See our [working group page]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/working-groups/geospatial) for general information about the working group. 

Our main goals are to:
* provide continued input on the development of SCINet,
* improve the computational capacity of ARS geospatial researchers, and
* develop collaborative research projects.

The goals of the 2023 workshop are to:
* provide hands-on learning on how to incorporate machine learning and deep learning in geospatial research,
* foster research efforts that had previously been un-attainable due to technical limitations or inexperience, and
* inspire new working group objectives.

## Review of previous workshops

### 2019 Workshop (Las Cruces, NM)

At the 2019 workshop, we heard from ARS scientists about successes and challenges of using SCINet for geospatial analysis, identified common issues and barriers to using SCINet for geospatial research workflows, generated recommendations for overcoming these issues/barriers, created the SCINet Geospatial Research Working Group to follow through with workshop recommendations, and learned about machine learning, deep learning, and some of the ways ML/DL are being used for research at New Mexico State University and the Jornada Experimental Range.

### 2020 Workshop (Virtual)

The 2020 Workshop was planned following the key needs identified in the community in 2019 workshop. The workshop opened with short introductions of the first cohort of SCINet postdocs and a discussion on the status and needs for the SCINet geospatial common data library and workbooks. Participants were introduced to the Ceres HPC and worked through several tutorials ranging in complexity from the basic various ways to run jobs on Ceres, to running on clusters in parallel, reproducible research best practices, and a real world example of running an analysis on Ceres. Most of these tutorials were in a Python and JupyterLab framework. The workshop closed with seminars and a panel of researchers in academia and industry discussing their machine learning workflows to improve agricultural practices.

### 2022 Workshop (Virtual)

The [2022 Workshop]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/2022-08-25-Geospatial-Workshop) was designed to help reduce the barrier to entry in migrating geospatial workflows to SCINet resources. Presentations and tutorials focused on showcasing how to perform basic geospatial operations and analyses in R and Python, discern which operations are embarassingly parallel, employ basic parallel processing options in R and Python, submit SLURM jobs, and use the interactive environments available via Open OnDemand. 

# Overview presentation
