# Practicum AI

Developed and presented by the University of Florida and customized for USDA-ARS with funding from ARS’s AI Center of Excellence, *Practicum AI* is a hands-on applied artificial intelligence (AI) curriculum intended for learners with limited coding and math background. Using hands-on exercises and graphically based, conceptual content, the program starts from introductory content and builds your AI knowledge, enabling you to design and conduct AI work. **Starting this fall, the University of Florida Research Computing team will be offering a series of courses to help ARS researchers begin using AI.** In January, a more advanced course on computer vision will be offered.

To register for these courses, please [fill out the registration form](https://forms.office.com/g/YnnYsxX9e3). You do not need to register for all courses and may instead register for only the courses that are most relevant to your work. You will need a SCINet account for all but Course 1. If you do not have a SCINet account, you may [request one](/about/signup).

FY24 (Q1 and Q2) Practicum AI courses:
Each course will be on Monday and Wednesday from 1:00-5:00 pm Eastern Time.

## Course 1 – Getting Started with AI

This course provides a high-level overview of the concepts, history, and vocabulary of AI. You will get hands-on experience with simple online AI tools, experimenting with gathering data, and training a model. We will review the general process that underlies most AI application development pathways and briefly touch on ethical aspects of AI that will also help ensure more reliable AI models.  

**Prerequisites –** None! This is our introductory course and assumes no technical background.
**Objectives** – Learners will be able to:
1.	Understand the interplay among and definitions of AI, machine learning, and data science.
1.	Recall significant historical events in AI and the advantages of high-performance computing for AI development.
1.	Recognize four real-world AI use cases, including datasets and model types.
1.	Comprehend the nature of AI models, identify major types, and the features required for each.
1.	Understand the AI application development process.
1.	Appreciate key principles in AI: transparency, inclusion, accountability, reliability, and security/privacy.
