# Practicum AI

Developed and presented by the University of Florida and customized for USDA-ARS with funding from ARS’s AI Center of Excellence, *Practicum AI* is a hands-on applied artificial intelligence (AI) curriculum intended for learners with limited coding and math background. Using hands-on exercises and graphically based, conceptual content, the program starts from introductory content and builds your AI knowledge, enabling you to design and conduct AI work. **Starting this fall, the University of Florida Research Computing team will be offering a series of courses to help ARS researchers begin using AI.** In January, a more advanced course on computer vision will be offered.

To register for these courses, please [fill out the registration form](https://forms.office.com/g/YnnYsxX9e3). You do not need to register for all courses and may instead register for only the courses that are most relevant to your work. You will need a SCINet account for all but Course 1. If you do not have a SCINet account, you may [request one](/about/signup).

FY24 (Q1 and Q2) Practicum AI courses:
Each course will be on Monday and Wednesday from 1:00-5:00 pm Eastern Time.
1.	Oct 30 & Nov 1: *[Getting Started with AI](/events/2023-10-30-Practicum-AI#course-1--getting-started-with-ai)*
1.	Nov 6 & Nov 8: *[Computing for AI](/events/2023-11-06-Practicum-AI#course-2--computing-for-ai)*
1.	Dec 4 & Dec 6: *[Python for AI](/events/2023-12-04-Practicum-AI#course-3--python-for-ai)*
1.	Jan 8 & Jan 10: *[Deep Learning Foundations](/events/2024-01-08-Practicum-AI#course-4--deep-learning-foundations)*

## Course 4 – Deep Learning Foundations

Deep learning is the focus of modern AI. Models have many layers and millions, or now approaching a trillion, parameters! This course breaks things down and introduces you to a small AI model to provide a conceptual understanding of how AI models are built, trained, and deployed.

**Prerequisites** – Python for AI content: Basics of Python coding and Pandas
**Objectives** – Learners will be able to:
1.	Define neural networks, their basic components (neurons, perceptrons, bias, weights), and activation functions.
2.	Understand the significance of deep networks in neural computation.
3.	Utilize deep learning for image tasks, from classification to training with Keras' MNIST package.
4.	Dive into TensorFlow and perceptron implementation.
5.	Grasp key concepts like gradient descent, optimizers, and the chain rule.
6.	Discuss the role of loss functions in network training.
7.	Explore applications in image classification and Natural Language Processing using pre-trained models.
