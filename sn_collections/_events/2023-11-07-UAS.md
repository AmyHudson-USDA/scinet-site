The focus of this workshop is to process Unoccupied Aerial System (UAS) image data using the open-source software Open Drone Map (ODM) on Atlas. The sessions will go through the entire process of image processing, from collecting UAS imagery and corresponding Ground Control Points (GCPs), to creating the GCP file needed for processing, to moving UAS images to Atlas and submitting a SLURM script using ODM in a container.<!--excerpt--> There will also be discussion about improvements to the workflow and creating a working group. 

There will be four sessions over Nov 7th and 9th. To register, please [fill out this form.](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=5zZb7e4BvE6GfuA8-g1Gl9poyUcOaMNCuMezzydam55URVE4VzA1WVpaRFYzT1NHVzI3Q001WUE5NCQlQCN0PWcu)  

**Instructors:**  
  * Andrea Albright, SCINet Postdoctoral Fellow, ARS Southeast Watershed Research Laboratory  
  * Aleksandra Badaczewska (Alex), Research Scientist IV, Iowa State University VRSC-GIF-ISU

## Tutorial instructions
{:.border-bottom}

Steps to prepare for the tutorial:

1. **Login to Ceres Open OnDemand** at [https://ceres-ondemand-dev.scinet.usda.gov/](https://ceres-ondemand-dev.scinet.usda.gov/). For more information on SCINet login procedures, see the [SCINet access user guide](https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/access/login).

1. **Launch a Jupyter session.** Under the *Interactive Apps* menu, select *Jupyter*. Specify the following input values on the page:

    * Account Name: scinet_workshop1
    * Queue: medium---------------- Max Time: 7-00:00:00
    * QOS: 400thread
    * Number of hours: 4
    * Number of cores: 2
    * Memory required: 6000M
    * Job name: Jupyter
    * Extra Optional Slurm Arguments: \-\-reservation=scinet_workshop1
    * Jupyter Notebook vs Lab: Lab
    * Working Directory: $HOME
  
    Click *Launch*. The screen will update to the *Interactive Sessions* page. When your Jupyter session is ready, the top card will update from *Queued* to *Running* and a *Connect to Jupyter* button will appear. Click *Connect to Jupyter*.

1. **Open a terminal session within JupyterLab.** Within JupyterLab, open the "File" menu, then "New" -> "Terminal".

1. **Copy the from the workshop files to your temporary workshop folder.** 
    Copy/paste into the terminal.
   
    ```bash
    /project/scinet_workshop1/workshop_setup.sh
    ```

1. **Setup the Julia kernel for JupyterLab.** Load Julia and install a Jupyter notebook kernel.
    Load the Julia module (version 1.7.0). Note: this is not the most recent version of Julia available on Ceres, but it's the version needed for this demo.

    ```bash
    module load julia/1.7.0
    julia
    ```

This text output appears indicates the Julia REPL (read–eval–print loop):

```
$ julia

julia>
```


```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(“IJulia”)
using IJulia
installkernel(“Julia”)
```

Exit now that Jupyter functionality exists.
```julia
exit()
```

A Julia folder has now been set up in the home directory, which has a limited memory quota. The next code snippet will relocate the .julia hidden folder from the home directory to the /90daydata/shared/scinet_worshop1/$USER folder and create a soft link back to the home directory.

```bash
mv .julia* /90daydata/shared/scinet_workshop1/$USER/
chmod -R g+s /90daydata/shared/scinet_workshop1/$USER/.julia*
ln -s /90daydata/shared/scinet_workshop1/$USER/.julia* ./
```

Go back to Julia and activate the kernel environment for the demo
```bash
julia
```

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate("/project/scinet_workshop1/julia_geo")
Pkg.instantiate()
```
Now the kernel should be ready in the notebook: 01_Open_Drone_Map_Processing_v1.ipynb
