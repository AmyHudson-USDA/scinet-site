The focus of this workshop is to process Unoccupied Aerial System (UAS) image data using the open-source software Open Drone Map (ODM) on Atlas. The sessions will go through the entire process of image processing, from collecting UAS imagery and corresponding Ground Control Points (GCPs), to creating the GCP file needed for processing, to moving UAS images to Atlas and submitting a SLURM script using ODM in a container.<!--excerpt--> There will also be discussion about improvements to the workflow and creating a working group. 

There will be four sessions over Nov 7th and 9th. To register, please [fill out this form.](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=5zZb7e4BvE6GfuA8-g1Gl9poyUcOaMNCuMezzydam55URVE4VzA1WVpaRFYzT1NHVzI3Q001WUE5NCQlQCN0PWcu)
