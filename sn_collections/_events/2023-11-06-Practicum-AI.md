# Practicum AI

Developed and presented by the University of Florida and customized for USDA-ARS with funding from ARS’s AI Center of Excellence, *Practicum AI* is a hands-on applied artificial intelligence (AI) curriculum intended for learners with limited coding and math background. Using hands-on exercises and graphically based, conceptual content, the program starts from introductory content and builds your AI knowledge, enabling you to design and conduct AI work. **Starting this fall, the University of Florida Research Computing team will be offering a series of courses to help ARS researchers begin using AI.** In January, a more advanced course on computer vision will be offered.

To register for these courses, please [fill out the registration form](https://forms.office.com/g/YnnYsxX9e3). You do not need to register for all courses and may instead register for only the courses that are most relevant to your work. You will need a SCINet account for all but Course 1. If you do not have a SCINet account, you may [request one](/about/signup).

FY24 (Q1 and Q2) Practicum AI courses:
Each course will be on Monday and Wednesday from 1:00-5:00 pm Eastern Time.
1.	Oct 30 & Nov 1: *[Getting Started with AI](/events/2023-10-30-Practicum-AI#course-1--getting-started-with-ai)*
1.	Nov 6 & Nov 8: *[Computing for AI](/events/2023-11-06-Practicum-AI#course-2--computing-for-ai)*
1.	Dec 4 & Dec 6: *[Python for AI](/events/2023-12-04-Practicum-AI#course-3--python-for-ai)*
1.	Jan 8 & Jan 10: *[Deep Learning Foundations](/events/2024-01-08-Practicum-AI#course-4--deep-learning-foundations)*

## Course 2 – Computing for AI

This course is the second in the Practicum AI series. This course can also be taken on its own to familiarize yourself with some of the important tools used in data science and scientific computing.

In this course, you will learn about some of the tools recommended for building, testing, tweaking, and deploying AI models. You will learn about Jupyter Notebooks, Git, GitHub, and high-performance computing (HPC) environments. These are the key technologies that have become the industry standards for hands-on applied AI research and development.

**Prerequisites** – 1) A GitHub account and 2) a SCINet account.
**Objectives** – Learners will be able to:
1.	Describe essential technologies for hands-on AI applications, including Jupyter notebooks.
2.	Understand the role of Jupyter notebooks in AI data analysis and model development.
3.	Launch and use a Jupyter notebook session on SCINet’s Atlas cluster.
4.	Recognize the significance of version control for open and reproducible AI projects.
5.	Create and use a git repository.
6.	Grasp the computational demands of AI and the need for GPU-enhanced high-performance computing environments.
