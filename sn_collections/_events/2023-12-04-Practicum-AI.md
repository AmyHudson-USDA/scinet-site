# Practicum AI

Developed and presented by the University of Florida and customized for USDA-ARS with funding from ARS’s AI Center of Excellence, *Practicum AI* is a hands-on applied artificial intelligence (AI) curriculum intended for learners with limited coding and math background. Using hands-on exercises and graphically based, conceptual content, the program starts from introductory content and builds your AI knowledge, enabling you to design and conduct AI work. **Starting this fall, the University of Florida Research Computing team will be offering a series of courses to help ARS researchers begin using AI.** In January, a more advanced course on computer vision will be offered.

To register for these courses, please [fill out the registration form](https://forms.office.com/g/YnnYsxX9e3). You do not need to register for all courses and may instead register for only the courses that are most relevant to your work. You will need a SCINet account for all but Course 1. If you do not have a SCINet account, you may [request one](/about/signup).

FY24 (Q1 and Q2) Practicum AI courses:
Each course will be on Monday and Wednesday from 1:00-5:00 pm Eastern Time.
1.	Oct 30 & Nov 1: *[Getting Started with AI](/events/2023-10-30-Practicum-AI#course-1--getting-started-with-ai)*
1.	Nov 6 & Nov 8: *[Computing for AI](/events/2023-11-06-Practicum-AI#course-2--computing-for-ai)*
1.	Dec 4 & Dec 6: *[Python for AI](/events/2023-12-04-Practicum-AI#course-3--python-for-ai)*
1.	Jan 8 & Jan 10: *[Deep Learning Foundations](/events/2024-01-08-Practicum-AI#course-4--deep-learning-foundations)*

## Course 3 – Python for AI 

Most hands-on artificial intelligence work is currently done using the Python programming language. As such, some understanding of Python and computer programming is needed to be successful in applying AI. That said, it is truly astounding how much complex AI research can be accomplished with a few lines of code!

The content in this workshop is aimed at beginning coders who may have never programmed before. As with the rest of the Practicum AI workshops, we use Jupyter Notebooks for the learning experience. A Jupyter Notebook is an easy-to-use, yet powerful tool that supports interactive coding as well as nicely formatted explanatory text. Much of exploratory AI research is conducted in Jupyter Notebooks, and it is easy to transfer code from Notebooks to scripts when it is time to scale up analyses.

**Prerequisites** – Computing for AI content: Understanding git and GitHub, navigating Jupyter notebooks on Atlas.
**Objectives** – Learners will be able to:
1.	Understand Python's dominance in data science and its role in high-performance computing.
2.	Develop Python troubleshooting skills, including documentation referencing and error handling.
3.	Write Python code adhering to best practices for operators, variables, and functions.
4.	Utilize Python libraries through the import function and understand major AI libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.
5.	Manipulate and visualize data using Pandas and Matplotlib.
