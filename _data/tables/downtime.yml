    text: "<p>Ceres downtime is scheduled for  Monday, December 2 – Friday, December 6. This downtime is to rewire both power and networking on Ceres for the addition of additional compute nodes and to ready it for storage expansion.  </p>
    
    <p>We do not anticipate any further extended downtimes for rewiring, as this should allow us to maximize the size of Ceres simply by adding additional compute nodes. </p>
    
    <p>Since this affects the Authentication for SCINet, this will also affect logins to Data Transfer nodes at Ames, StoneVille, Fort Collins, Clay Center, Albany CA, and Beltsville.</p>
    
    <p>GlobalNoc will also be upgrading software on the SCINet network infrastructure during this time.</p>"
