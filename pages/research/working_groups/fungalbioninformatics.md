As technology advances in the field of molecular biology, so does the need for accurate and robust bioinformatics data analyses. The Fungal Bioinformatics Working Group was formed in December 2022 with the goal of developing centralized resources and a networking community for pathologists analyzing fungal and oomycete genomes. These resources are to include links to genome databases, optimized workflows and pipelines, and computing environments designed for fungal genome analyses. The group will meet once a month to discuss research, projects, and resource development.

Additionally, the working group hosts a bi-weekly journal club where participants take turns choosing research papers to read and discuss as a group. We also hope to host a Fungal Bioinformatics Workshop virtually in Spring 2023.

If you are interested in joining this group, please contact Kayla Pennerman ([kayla.pennerman@usda.gov](mailto:kayla.pennerman@usda.gov)) or Olive Stanley ([olive.stanley@usda.gov](mailto:olive.stanley@usda.gov).
