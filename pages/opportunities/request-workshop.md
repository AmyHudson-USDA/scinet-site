Each year, the SCINet initiative accepts two types of requests:

1) proposals for SCINet-funded workshops or training led by the applicant(s), and 

2) suggestions for workshops/training that you would like to see SCINet conduct.

## Proposals for Self-led SCINet-funded Workshops or Training 

The application period for self-led SCINet-funded workshops closed this year on Feb 1, 2020.

The FY21 application process will open later this year and a link to the application will be posted to this page in fall/winter 2020. 

<!--
### [Request for FY20 SCINet Workshop/Training Application](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SCINet) (Due Feb 1, 2020)
The SCINet initiative is currently accepting proposals for FY 2020 trainings and workshops. These events can span a broad range of activities from establishing/promoting SCINet-related computational working groups to conducting local or national computational trainings. Successful proposals must state how state how the workshop/training will promote the goals of SCINet, including: 
- improving high performance computing or big data analytical capabilities of ARS scientists
- increasing use of SCINet resources (e.g., Ceres, cloud computing) by ARS scientists or disciplines that are under-represented on SCINet
- improving access to ARS data. 
At your request, members of the SCINet Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC) can be available remotely or in-person to support your event. As part of the application, we ask that you consider aspects such as the number of attendees, the experience level required to participate, the type of travel authorization that will be required, if the event will be internal to USDA ARS or open to outside collaborators, and a cost estimate. 
If you would like to hold a SCINet-funded workshop or training in FY20, please submit this application by Feb 1, 2020 for full consideration. Submissions after this date will be contingent upon the availability of funds. Workshop or training dates proposed for May 4, 2020 or earlier may be given higher priority. Your request will be reviewed by the SCINet Advisory Committee and the ARS Chief Science Information Officer. Questions about the application can be sent to deb.peters@usda.gov.

## Suggestions for SCINet-led Workshops or Training

Suggestions for workshops or training that you see a need for and that SCINet should lead are accepted year-round at [scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV](mailto:scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV?subject=training%20suggestion).

For full consideration of your suggestion, please include the following information in your email:
1.  Describe the proposed workshop or training. Include information such as the topic area(s), ideal event style(s) (hands-on, interactive, working session, conference), and any other pertinent information.
2.  What should the learning goals or outcomes of the event be?
3.  What pre-requisite skills/knowledge, if any, should be required to attend?
4.  What does the ideal audience (attendees) look like? (i.e. administration level, RLs, scientists, statisticians, postdocs, data managers, technicians, students, collaborators)
5.  Cite/link to a documented need for the proposed event. State whether the need is broad-based (spans multiple disciplines or research units), confined to a specific research unit/location, or limited to the needs of a single individual.
6.  List any ARS employees who are knowledgeable of the topic area / suggest people who could be involved in leading the event.
