## Overview

The SCINet Program, in collaboration with the ARS Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence (AI-COE), is calling for proposals for funding to support postdoctoral fellows to be mentored by ARS scientists. The goal of the fellowship program is to develop the next generation of ARS scientists with expertise in conducting and leading individual and collaborative research using computationally intensive approaches. 

Each fellow should: (1) be involved in individual and collaborative, multi-unit research, (2) have training and leadership opportunities, and (3) contribute to the overall success of SCNet or the AI-COE and the Fellows Program. In addition, each fellow will have the opportunity to take advantage of training courses that build computational literacy, such as in data science, AI, bioinformatics, and geospatial analyses on SCINet's high-performance computing clusters (Ceres, Atlas).

The call for proposals is now open. The deadline for proposal submission is Friday, December 23, 2022. Please visit [https://forms.office.com/g/ULtMeH9Kp9](https://forms.office.com/g/ULtMeH9Kp9) for detailed instructions. Please note that FY22 awardees (PIs) will not be eligible for an FY23 award.
