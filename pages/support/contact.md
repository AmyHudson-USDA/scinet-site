The Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC) is a team of Iowa State University and ARS personnel who manage the maintenance and operation of the Ceres HPC system and provide user support. See the [Virtual Research Support Core page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/vrsc) for more details.

## How and When to Contact the VRSC

Discussion that is relevant to other SCINet users such as questions about the best practices for research computations should be posted on the [SCINet Forum](https://forum.scinet.usda.gov/) message board. Access to the Forum is provided during the SCINet account application process ([Apply for an Account]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/signup)).

If your question is related to SCINet policy or development, contact the acting SCINet Program Manager, Stan Kosecki.

Single user operational questions should be emailed to the VRSC at [Ceres](mailto:scinet_vrsc@usda.gov) or [Atlas](mailto:help-usda@hpc.msstate.edu). Support requests for login issues on _either_ Ceres or Atlas should be sent to [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](mailto:scinet_vrsc@usda.gov).  Examples of the kinds of questions/requests that should be sent to the support email addresses include:

* I can’t login
* I’m having problems with a batch script
* I’m have a problem with storage
* How do I use software package X?
* Please update software application X on Ceres.
* Please add user X to project Y.
* I need help with script/program optimization or making a program run faster

Again, please note that support requests for login issues on _either_ Ceres or Atlas should be sent to [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](mailto:scinet_vrsc@usda.gov).
