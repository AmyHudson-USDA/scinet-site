## What is SCINet?

SCINet is the USDA-ARS's initiative for scientific computing. It consists of:

1. High performance computer clusters for running command-line and graphical programs. There are currently two clusters: Ceres cluster in Ames IA and Atlas cluster in Starkville MS. SCINet also offers AWS cloud computing. See [SCINet HPC Systems](/about/compute) for more detail.
2. Network improvements across ARS.
3. Support for computing through the Virtual Research Support Core (VRSC). See [VRSC Support](/support/vrsc/) for more detail.
4. Training and workshop opportunities in multiple areas of scientific computing. See [upcoming](/training/training_event) and [past](/training-archive/) trainings and [upcoming](/events/upcoming_events) and [past](/events-archive) events for more information.

Users who are new to the HPC environment may benefit from the [SCINet/Ceres onboarding video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FspDMlHaJUY) which covers most of the material contained in this guide. Note that /KEEP storage discussed in the video at 16:20 is no longer available. Instead data that cannot be easily reproduced should be manually backed up to [Juno](https://scinet.usda.gov/guide/storage/#juno-archive-storage). The instructional video at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3lnsCAfx3Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3lnsCAfx3Q) demonstrates how to transfer files between local computer, Ceres, Atlas and Juno using Globus.
